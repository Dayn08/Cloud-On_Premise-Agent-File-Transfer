# Cloud On-Premise Agent File Transfer
This project demonstrates a cloud-hosted server and multiple on-premise clients (agents) communicating securely through HTTP. The server can trigger file downloads from any connected client on demand, even if clients are behind NAT or not publicly accessible.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

1. **Client (On-premise)**  
   - Connects to the cloud server.
   - Waits for file download requests.
   - Sends file data to the server when requested.

2. **Server (Cloud-hosted)**  
   - Accepts client connections.
   - Initiates file download through API or CLI.
   - Saves received files locally.
